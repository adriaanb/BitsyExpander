# Bitsy Expander RP2040 Pinout Diagrams
## Standard Usage
Unlike the ItsyBitsy M4, which includes two more analog pins (and two DAC's), the RP2040 replaces these with two additional digital pins. The RP2040 affords greater flexibility in GPIO pin usage, but extra planning and research may be needed to fully leverage this advantage.

**For detailed information on the ItsyBitsy RP2040's pinout, refer to Adafruit's documentation:**

## Arduino Support
The pin markings on the BitsyExpander RP2040 as well as on the ItsyBitsy RP2040 itself apply solely for use with [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_itsybitsy_rp2040/). To program the board using [Arduino](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-itsybitsy-rp2040/arduino-ide-setup), the following pin map applies:
